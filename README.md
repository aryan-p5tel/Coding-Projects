# Coding Projects

## About

This repository contains small projects Iâ€™ve built to practice and improve my programming skills.

Finished GCSE Computer Science a year early and wanted to continue coding with real life tools. 
Hope to go into an IT related job and developing skills on:

- Github
- VS Code
- Postman
- PyCharm
- Replit

# Python Learning Projects  

This repository is a collection of my early Python projects, created as part of my journey to build confidence with programming and explore how code can solve real-world problems. Each project here represents a step forward in my understanding of Python concepts â€” from simple file handling to developing interactive graphical user interfaces (GUIs).  

I chose to document my progress on GitHub not only to showcase my work, but also to practice working in a collaborative, version-controlled environment â€” skills that are essential in both higher education and industry.

##  Projects Included  

###  Car Wash Simulation (GUI)  
- **Description:** A full-featured Tkinter simulation where users can choose vehicle type, service type, optional extras, and tips. Includes currency conversion with real-time price updates after confirmation.  
- **Complexity:** This was my most challenging project so far. It required problem-solving across multiple areas â€” GUI design, event-driven programming, global variables, live updates, and integrating logic for services, extras, and currencies.  
- **Learning Outcome:** Built confidence in tackling larger projects with multiple moving parts, while also learning how to debug, refactor, and adapt code with the help of online tutorials and additional guidance.

###  Notes App (File Handling)  
- **Description:** A simple console-based application that allows users to create, view, and delete notes stored in a text file.  
- **Key Skills:**  
  - Reading and writing to text files  
  - Appending vs overwriting data  
  - Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations  
- **Learning Outcome:** Strengthened my understanding of how persistent data can be managed in Python, forming a foundation for more advanced storage methods later (databases, structured file formats).  

---

###  File Handling Practice  
- **Description:** A set of small experiments with opening, closing, reading, and writing files.  
- **Key Skills:**  
  - File I/O operations (`open`, `read`, `write`, `close`)  
  - Managing errors and ensuring data integrity  
- **Learning Outcome:** Gained confidence with one of the most fundamental skills in programming â€” working with files. These smaller exercises laid the groundwork for projects like the Notes App.

###  Tkinter GUI Practice  
- **Description:** Short, practice programs exploring how to design graphical user interfaces using Tkinter.  
- **Key Skills:**  
  - Widgets (`Labels`, `Buttons`, `Entry`, `Radiobuttons`, `OptionMenus`)  
  - Layout managers (`pack`, `grid`)  
  - Event-driven programming and callbacks  
- **Learning Outcome:** Established a base understanding of GUI development, which made the more complex Car Wash Simulation possible.

##  Why GitHub?  
I decided to keep these projects on GitHub to:  
- Learn how to use version control to manage my work.  
- Build a portfolio of evidence that demonstrates consistent progress.  
- Gain early experience with collaborative tools, preparing for both university coursework and professional teamwork.  

By using GitHub as part of my workflow now, Iâ€™m developing habits that will help me adapt quickly to real software development environments where collaboration, documentation, and clarity are essential.

##  Summary  
These projects are simple in scope but deliberate in purpose: each one builds upon the last, steadily expanding my skills. The Car Wash Simulation showcases my ability to combine everything Iâ€™ve learned into a more advanced project, while the smaller apps highlight my focus on mastering fundamentals.  

This repository is a snapshot of my journey into software development â€” one that reflects enthusiasm, self-motivation, and a readiness to take on more challenging work in the future.
